# i-share
i-share is a real time share tool where you can share urls between mobile and pc.

### Main purpose
Sometimes I have struggled when I found interesting content to read (mostly about technology and software) on my pc or mobile. Because I am in a position to move often I need extra space to test some scenarios and test cases. So, my main purpose of this tool is to sync in real-time this content when I use my mobile and like to continue on a pc or vice versa.

### Where can be used
Only for internal use
